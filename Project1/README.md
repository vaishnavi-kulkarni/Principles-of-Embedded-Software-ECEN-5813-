## Command line interface for memory manipulation

### Project Description
We have developed this command line interface on a linux machhine for memory manipulation, It performs the following set of functions:

help: Lists all the functions with a short description which allows user to easily navigate through this interface
allocate:Allocates a user-specified number of bytes or words in memory
free: Free up the amount of memory set aside with 'allocate'
display: Display the contents of memory in hex format 
write: Write a 32 bit value to a specified address
invert: Execute a NOT operation to invert all bits in a memory location
write_pattern: Write a Pseudo random pattern in a specified area of memory
verify_pattern: Verify a Pseudo random pattern in a specified area of memory
quit: Quit the program and return to the command line

we have made certain modifications to run this on FRDM KL25Z. The folder Arm version contains files for FRDM KL25Z
